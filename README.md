# Cat_vs_Dog_classification
- This project involves building a Streamlit App for an Image Classification task.
- Specifically, we built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify an image to be either a dog or a cat.
- Then, we created a streamlit app to deploy this model so users can test it.
